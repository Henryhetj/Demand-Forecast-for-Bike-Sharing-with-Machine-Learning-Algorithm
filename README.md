# Demand-Forecast-for-Bike-Sharing-with-Machine-Learning-Algorithm

Predicted bike renting demands for stations with the mass data for a bike service provider.

Preprocessed three huge datasets covering one year, did feature engineering and merged the datasets; Applied logistic regression
to train the classifier to predict the weather with accuracy 91.23%; Utilized both classical statistical time series algorithms (MA,
Holt Winter, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA and etc.) and machine learning models (Linear, Ridge and Lasso regression) to
predict bike usage. Tuned parameters to get the optimal R squared for best fitting model to predict demands.
